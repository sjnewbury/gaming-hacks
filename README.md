Various games with fixes and improvements

Many ebuilds in this overlay use the deprecated/banned games.eclass, including
several which were purged from the portage tree as a result.  This includes
quake3, and the ut2004 mods.

I will gradully convert them to use remove the dependency on games.eclass but
wanted to preserve them in working state.

TODO:

Convert games.eclass ebuilds

Create new mod eclass' for quake3 and ut2004 etc

Run repoman and fix QA issues
